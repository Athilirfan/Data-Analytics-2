1.Regression Dashboard:
      First, I have choose prediction of bodyfat dataset from the given drive then I opened google data studio and upload my csv file named bodyfat.csv.
I decide to do six different charts regarding to the bodyfat dataset. The chart that I given in the dashboard are:
     1.Stacked Column Chart
     2.Gauge with Ranges
     3.Table with Bars
     4.Doughtnut Chart
     5.Stacked Combo Chart
     6.Scorecard
2.Descriptive Analysis:
      For descriptive analysis, I choose Jupyter notebook platform to run the python code of bodyfat dataset.
I import pandas library then I had perform the following functions. They are:
      1.Median
      2.Mode
      3.Mean
      4.Quantile
      5.Describe
      6.IQR
      7.Variance
      8.Standard Deviation
      9.Median Absolute Deviation
      10.Skewness
      11.Kurtosis
3.Linear Regression:
       In this work I import pandas and numpy also matplotlib. I got the bodyfat dataset in jupyter notebook by giving the file path and I find the shape,tail,drop and head of the bodyfat dataset. Next, I perform scatter plot in Data Visualization by defining x and y variable. Then, I installed and import Linear Regression and getting the dataframe in the dataset.
       And I perform test and predict of x,y in Linear Regression.
